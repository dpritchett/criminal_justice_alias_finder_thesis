# Explore multiple methods to detect aliases and clerical errors in a federated criminal justice database

This source code was written in 2004 and 2005 by [*Daniel J. Pritchett*](http://www.sharingatwork.com) in support of a thesis for a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Alabama.

The tools used are PHP and MySQL - the 2005 stable versions.  Databases were hosted on Windows XP Professional workstations in a university computer lab.

A quick perusal of the code will reveal a naive lack of XHTML compliance, any sort of CSS, source control, and robust test automation.

I have learned a lot about software engineering since then and I'm currently revisiting PHP (and Clojure and several other technologies).  Follow along on [my Posterous blog](http://dpritchett.posterous.com) or here on github if you're curious.
